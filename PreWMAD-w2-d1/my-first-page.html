      <p>
        Hello, there! Here is a bit of myself; I was born and raised in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, Japan.
        (It's a beautiful harbor city!) <br />Currently I'm joining the classes
        from Japan, and planning to fly to Vancouver in the next month.<br />
        <em>Can't wait to meet all of you!</em>

        I'm looking forward to exploring the beatutiful nature in Vancouver and
        enjoy myself trying a lot of new things! (including entering into the
        tech field) <br />
